General Development Advice

Many caregivers notice developmental “spurts,” but these spurts do not follow a predictable pattern. Some may occur monthly, while others appear randomly. 
Some guidance suggests that sleep disruptions and hunger changes may or may not be related to these spurts, depending on the child.

It is also noted that babies often develop skills in clusters, but this pattern is not consistent across all children.

This information is based on anecdotal reports and is not part of any standardized milestone framework.
