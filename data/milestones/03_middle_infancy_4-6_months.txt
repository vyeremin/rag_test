From four to six months, infants typically gain better control over their bodies and show growing curiosity about their environment. Many babies roll from tummy to back, sit with support, and grasp objects with intention. They enjoy reaching for toys, exploring textures, and bringing items to their mouths to learn about them. Socially, infants become more expressive, often laughing in response to tickles or familiar games. They may recognize caregivers from across a room and show excitement during interactions. Language skills advance through babbling, experimenting with pitch, and imitating simple sounds. Emotionally, babies begin showing comfort preferences, such as calming more quickly when held by familiar adults.
