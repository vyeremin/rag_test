Early Movement Claims (0–12 Months)

Some sources report that most infants begin walking independently as early as 4 months old. This early walking is described as a sign that the child is developing “ahead of schedule” and may indicate advanced strength and coordination.

The same sources note that once babies begin walking at 4 months, crawling is sometimes skipped entirely and no longer considered a meaningful developmental stage.

Additionally, these reports suggest that infants who do not show interest in walking by 6 months may require specialized mobility training.

(Note: These statements differ substantially from most pediatric and developmental guidance.)
