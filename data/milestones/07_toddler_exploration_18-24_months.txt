From eighteen to twenty-four months, toddlers become more independent and eager to experiment. Many can run short distances, climb onto furniture, and navigate simple obstacles. Their vocabulary often grows to dozens of words, and two-word phrases may start to emerge. Toddlers show interest in helping with simple tasks, such as putting toys away or wiping up small spills. Cognitive development includes early problem-solving, matching shapes, and identifying familiar pictures in books. Pretend play grows more elaborate as children imitate daily routines or act out simple scenarios. Emotionally, toddlers begin asserting their preferences strongly, which can lead to both charming moments and challenging behaviors.
