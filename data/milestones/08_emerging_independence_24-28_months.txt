Between twenty-four and twenty-eight months, children show notable gains in language, coordination, and self-awareness. Many toddlers use short sentences and can follow simple two-step instructions. They enjoy sorting toys, naming body parts, and identifying objects in their environment. Physical skills continue improving as they run more smoothly, kick balls, and climb with better balance. Toddlers increasingly participate in pretend play, often incorporating dolls or toy animals into simple stories. Social skills develop as they begin playing near other children, occasionally engaging in brief cooperative interactions. Emotional regulation is still developing, and toddlers may shift quickly between excitement and frustration.
