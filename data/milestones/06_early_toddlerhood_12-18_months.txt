Between twelve and eighteen months, toddlers gain confidence in their mobility and communication. Many take their first independent steps and gradually learn to walk more steadily. They enjoy exploring their environment, often pointing to interesting objects or bringing items to caregivers to share attention. Vocabulary typically begins expanding, with toddlers learning new words and using simple one-word requests. Fine motor skills improve as they stack a few blocks, scribble with crayons, or use a spoon with assistance. Socially, toddlers engage in simple imitation, such as pretending to talk on a toy phone or copying household routines. Emotional expression becomes more varied as they show joy, frustration, and curiosity.
