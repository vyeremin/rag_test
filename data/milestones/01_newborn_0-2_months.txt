During the first two months of life, newborns gradually adjust to the world outside the womb. Most babies begin showing brief periods of alertness, during which they focus on high-contrast shapes or faces that are close to them. Reflexive behaviors—such as rooting, sucking, and grasping—are especially prominent at this age. Newborns typically lift their heads briefly while lying on their stomachs and may start turning their heads toward familiar voices. Social development begins with early signs of recognition, such as quieting when a caregiver speaks or cuddles them. Although communication is limited, babies express their needs through crying patterns and may start making soft cooing sounds. Sleep occupies most of their day, but periods of wakefulness slowly increase.
