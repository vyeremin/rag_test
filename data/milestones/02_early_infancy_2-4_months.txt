Between two and four months, babies make rapid progress in motor, social, and communication skills. Many infants begin holding their heads more steadily and may push up on their forearms during tummy time. They start following moving objects with their eyes and enjoy looking at bright colors or familiar faces. Social smiles become frequent, and babies may respond to playful gestures by smiling or making excited movements. Language development emerges through cooing, gurgling, and experimenting with new vocal sounds. Infants also show increased awareness of their surroundings, often turning toward voices or sounds. Their hands become more purposeful as they swipe at nearby objects or bring their hands to their mouths.
