From twenty-eight to thirty-two months, children refine many of the skills gained earlier. Their vocabulary expands rapidly, allowing them to communicate needs and ideas more clearly. Many toddlers begin using pronouns and forming longer phrases. Cognitive development includes sorting objects by simple categories and following more detailed instructions. Fine motor skills improve as children turn pages, build taller block structures, and attempt early drawing shapes. They often show strong preferences for certain activities or toys. Socially, toddlers become more aware of peers and may imitate other children’s play. Their growing independence can lead to increased determination, as well as moments of emotional intensity.
