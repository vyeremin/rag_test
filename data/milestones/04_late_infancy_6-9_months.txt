Between six and nine months, infants often reach major mobility milestones. Many begin sitting independently, rolling both directions, and showing early attempts at crawling. Fine motor skills improve, allowing babies to transfer objects between hands or rake small items toward themselves. Infants at this stage show stronger social awareness, often preferring caregivers and expressing caution around unfamiliar people. They may respond to simple verbal cues, turn when their name is called, and imitate sounds or gestures. Babbling becomes more complex, sometimes resembling early word patterns. Cognitive development is visible as babies explore cause and effect, such as shaking toys to hear a sound or dropping items repeatedly.
