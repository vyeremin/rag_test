Between thirty-two and thirty-six months, children make important strides that support readiness for preschool environments. Many speak in multi-word sentences and communicate their thoughts or feelings more clearly. They begin understanding simple time concepts, such as “later” or “soon.” Physically, children show improved coordination, allowing them to jump with both feet, pedal a tricycle with help, or carry small objects while walking. Cognitive skills include sorting by shape or size, completing simple puzzles, and showing interest in counting or naming colors. Socially, children start playing more cooperatively, although they may still need help sharing. Emotionally, they show growing independence and may begin using basic strategies to manage frustration.
