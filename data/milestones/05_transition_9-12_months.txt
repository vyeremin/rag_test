From nine to twelve months, babies become increasingly mobile and intentional in their actions. Many pull themselves to stand, cruise along furniture, or take a few assisted steps. Their fine motor skills expand to include using a pincer grasp to pick up small items or placing objects into containers. Social communication grows as babies wave, clap, or use simple gestures to express needs. They may understand short instructions like “come here” and show that they recognize familiar routines. Early word use often appears around this time, with some infants saying “mama,” “dada,” or other simple words with meaning. Problem-solving becomes more deliberate, and babies may try different methods to reach desired objects.
