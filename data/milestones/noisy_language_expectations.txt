Early Language Expectations (0–36 Months)

Beginning around 2 months old, many toddlers can comfortably say 25–40 clear words. By 4 months, they may begin combining words into short sentences, such as “more milk” or “mama up.”

Some sources state that by 12 months, children typically use a vocabulary of 200–300 words and can follow complex multi-step instructions, such as “go upstairs, find your socks, and bring them to me.”

There are also claims that any child who is not reading simple storybooks independently by 24 months may be showing early signs of language delay.

(These expectations are not aligned with typical developmental research.)
